# Centralized Peer-to-Peer architecture for File Sharing

The aim of this project is to provide a file sharing system, among the peers connected to the network, administered by a centralized server.


### TASKS
- [] Handle the problem of 0 byte files.
- [] Files seems to be merging properly, but with some additional chars. Handle it.
- [] Retentering username after entering used one is buggy. Probably due to use of goto.
