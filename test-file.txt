The Schrödinger equation is a linear partial differential equation that describes the wave function or state function of a quantum-mechanical system.[1]:1–2 It is a key result in quantum mechanics, and its discovery was a significant landmark in the development of the subject. The equation is named after Erwin Schrödinger, who postulated the equation in 1925, and published it in 1926, forming the basis for the work that resulted in his Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933.
In classical mechanics, Newton's second law (F = ma)[note 1] is used to make a mathematical prediction as to what path a given physical system will take over time following a set of known initial conditions. Solving this equation gives the position and the momentum of the physical system as a function of the external force {\displaystyle \mathbf {F} }\mathbf {F}  on the system. 
Those two parameters are sufficient to describe its state at each time instant. In quantum mechanics, the analogue of Newton's law is Schrödinger's equation.

The concept of a wave function is a fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics; the wave function defines the state of the system at each spatial position, and time. Using these postulates, Schrödinger's equation can be derived from the fact that the time-evolution operator must be unitary, and must therefore be generated by the exponential of a self-adjoint operator, which is the quantum Hamiltonian. This derivation is explained below.

In the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, the wave function is the most complete description that can be given of a physical system. Solutions to Schrödinger's equation describe not only molecular, atomic, and subatomic systems, but also macroscopic systems, possibly even the whole universe.[4]:292ff

The Schrödinger equation is not the only way to study quantum mechanical systems and make predictions. The other formulations of quantum mechanics include matrix mechanics, introduced by Werner Heisenberg, and the path integral formulation, developed chiefly by Richard Feynman. Paul Dirac incorporated matrix mechanics and the Schrödinger equation into a single formulation.
Equation
Time-dependent equation
The form of the Schrödinger equation depends on the physical situation (see below for special cases). The most general form is the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE), which gives a description of a system evolving with time:[5]:143


A wave function that satisfies the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation with V = 0. In other words, this corresponds to a particle traveling freely through empty space. The real part of the wave function is plotted here.
Time-dependent Schrödinger equation (general)
{\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {d}{dt}}\vert \Psi (t)\rangle ={\hat {H}}\vert \Psi (t)\rangle }{\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {d}{dt}}\vert \Psi (t)\rangle ={\hat {H}}\vert \Psi (t)\rangle }

where {\displaystyle i}i is the imaginary unit, {\displaystyle \hbar ={\frac {h}{2\pi }}}\hbar ={\frac  {h}{2\pi }} is the reduced Planck constant, {\displaystyle \Psi }\Psi  (the Greek letter psi) is the state vector of the quantum system, {\displaystyle t}t is time, and {\displaystyle {\hat {H}}}{\hat {H}} is the Hamiltonian operator. The position-space wave function of the quantum system is nothing but the components in the expansion of the state vector in terms of the position eigenvector {\displaystyle \vert \mathbf {r} \rangle }{\displaystyle \vert \mathbf {r} \rangle }. It is a scalar function, expressed as {\displaystyle \Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)=\langle \mathbf {r} \vert \Psi \rangle }{\displaystyle \Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)=\langle \mathbf {r} \vert \Psi \rangle }. Similarly, the momentum-space wave function can be defined as {\displaystyle {\tilde {\Psi }}(\mathbf {p} ,t)=\langle \mathbf {p} \vert \Psi \rangle }{\displaystyle {\tilde {\Psi }}(\mathbf {p} ,t)=\langle \mathbf {p} \vert \Psi \rangle }, where {\displaystyle \vert \mathbf {p} \rangle }{\displaystyle \vert \mathbf {p} \rangle } is the momentum eigenvector.


Each of these three rows is a wave function which satisfies the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for a harmonic oscillator. Left: The real part (blue) and imaginary part (red) of the wave function. Right: The probability distribution of finding the particle with this wave function at a given position. The top two rows are examples of stationary states, which correspond to standing waves. The bottom row is an example of a state which is not a stationary state. The right column illustrates why stationary states are called "stationary".
The most famous example is the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation for the wave function in position space {\displaystyle \Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)}\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t) of a single particle subject to a potential {\displaystyle V(\mathbf {r} ,t)}{\displaystyle V(\mathbf {r} ,t)}, such as that due to an electric field.[6][note 2]

Time-dependent Schrödinger equation in position basis
(single nonrelativistic particle)
{\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)=\left[{\frac {-\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\nabla ^{2}+V(\mathbf {r} ,t)\right]\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)}{\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)=\left[{\frac {-\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\nabla ^{2}+V(\mathbf {r} ,t)\right]\Psi (\mathbf {r} ,t)}

where {\displaystyle m}m is the particle's mass, and {\displaystyle \nabla ^{2}}\nabla ^{2} is the Laplacian.

This is also a diffusion equation, but unlike the heat equation, this one is also a wave equation given the imaginary unit present in the transient term.

The term "Schrödinger equation" can refer to both the general equation, or the specific nonrelativistic version. The general equation is indeed quite general, used throughout quantum mechanics, for everything from the Dirac equation to quantum field theory, by plugging in diverse expressions for the Hamiltonian. The specific nonrelativistic version is a strictly classical approximation to reality and yields accurate results in many situations, but only to a certain extent (see relativistic quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory).

To apply the Schrödinger equation, write down the Hamiltonian for the system, accounting for the kinetic and potential energies of the particles constituting the system, then insert it into the Schrödinger equation. The resulting partial differential equation is solved for the wave function, which contains information about the system.

Time-independent equation
The time-dependent Schrödinger equation described above predicts that wave functions can form standing waves, called stationary states.[note 3] These states are particularly important as their individual study later simplifies the task of solving the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for any state. Stationary states can also be described by a simpler form of the Schrödinger equation, the time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE).

Time-independent Schrödinger equation (general)
{\displaystyle \operatorname {\hat {H}} |\Psi \rangle =E|\Psi \rangle }{\displaystyle \operatorname {\hat {H}} |\Psi \rangle =E|\Psi \rangle }

where {\displaystyle E}E is a constant equal to the energy level of the system. This is only used when the Hamiltonian itself is not dependent on time explicitly. However, even in this case the total wave function still has a time dependency.

In the language of linear algebra, this equation is an eigenvalue equation. Therefore, the wave function is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian operator with corresponding eigenvalue(s) {\displaystyle E}E.

As before, the most common manifestation is the nonrelativistic Schrödinger equation for a single particle moving in an electric field (but not a magnetic field):

Time-independent Schrödinger equation (single nonrelativistic particle)
{\displaystyle \left[{\frac {-\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\nabla ^{2}+V(\mathbf {r} )\right]\Psi (\mathbf {r} )=E\Psi (\mathbf {r} )}{\displaystyle \left[{\frac {-\hbar ^{2}}{2m}}\nabla ^{2}+V(\mathbf {r} )\right]\Psi (\mathbf {r} )=E\Psi (\mathbf {r} )}

with definitions as above. Here, the form of the Hamiltonian operator comes from classical mechanics, where the Hamiltonian function is the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. That is, {\displaystyle H=T+V={\frac {\|\mathbf {p} \|^{2}}{2m}}+V(x,y,z)}{\displaystyle H=T+V={\frac {\|\mathbf {p} \|^{2}}{2m}}+V(x,y,z)} for a single particle in the non-relativistic limit.

The time-independent Schrödinger equation is discussed further below.

Derivation
One may derive the Schrodinger equation starting from the Dirac-von Neumann axioms. Suppose the wave function {\displaystyle \psi (t_{0})}{\displaystyle \psi (t_{0})} represents a unit vector defined on a complex Hilbert space at some initial time {\displaystyle t_{0}}t_{0}. The unitarity principle requires that there must exist a linear operator, {\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)}{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)}, such that for any time {\displaystyle t>t_{0}}{\displaystyle t>t_{0}},

{\displaystyle \psi (t)={\hat {U}}(t)\psi (t_{0}).}{\displaystyle \psi (t)={\hat {U}}(t)\psi (t_{0}).}

Given that {\displaystyle \psi (t)}\psi(t) must remain a unit vector, the operator {\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)}{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)} must therefore be a unitary transformation. As such, there exists an exponential map such that {\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)=e^{-i{\hat {\mathcal {H}}}t}}{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)=e^{-i{\hat {\mathcal {H}}}t}} where {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathcal {H}}}}{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathcal {H}}}} is a Hermitian operator (given by the fact that the Lie algebra of the unitary group is generated by skew-Hermitian operators, and if {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathcal {H}}}}{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathcal {H}}}} is Hermitian, then {\displaystyle -i{\hat {\mathcal {H}}}}{\displaystyle -i{\hat {\mathcal {H}}}} is skew-Hermitian). Therefore, the first-order Taylor expansion of {\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)}{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)} centered at {\displaystyle t_{0}}t_{0} takes the form

{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)\approx 1-i(t-t_{0}){\hat {\mathcal {H}}}.}{\displaystyle {\hat {U}}(t)\approx 1-i(t-t_{0}){\hat {\mathcal {H}}}.}
And so, substituting the above expansion into (1) thus yields

{\displaystyle \psi (t)=\psi (t_{0})-i(t-t_{0}){\hat {\mathcal {H}}}\psi (t_{0}),}{\displaystyle \psi (t)=\psi (t_{0})-i(t-t_{0}){\hat {\mathcal {H}}}\psi (t_{0}),}
which, when rearranged and taken in the limit {\displaystyle t\rightarrow t_{0}}{\displaystyle t\rightarrow t_{0}}, provides an equation of the same form as the Schrödinger equation

{\displaystyle i{\frac {d\psi }{dt}}={\hat {\mathcal {H}}}\psi ,}{\displaystyle i{\frac {d\psi }{dt}}={\hat {\mathcal {H}}}\psi ,}
where the ordinary definition for the derivative was used. However, the operator {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathcal {H}}}}{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathcal {H}}}} used here denotes an arbitrary Hermitian operator. Nonetheless, by using the correspondence principle it is possible to show that in the classical limit, using appropriate units, the expectation value of {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathcal {H}}}}{\displaystyle {\hat {\mathcal {H}}}} indeed corresponds to the Hamiltonian of the system.[7]
