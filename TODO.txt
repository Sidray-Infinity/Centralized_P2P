   * Need to find a way to share the "BLOC LOC TABLE" with all the users.
   * Each peer with a copy of the table is very "blockchain" in nature.
     Maybe want to avoid it.
   * Thinking of making a single copy of the table with the server.
   * The peer can request to view the table at any time.
   * The server will respond with the filenames, from which, the peer can
     select the file to download.

  * The filenames transfer from server to client is complete.
  * Theres a bug in the DHT table after introducing the 'num_blocks' attribute to 
    the file structure fix it.

** Now that some mysql using C api testing is done, start implementing it.
  * Implement the login databse.
      - First create the required tables manually in mysql.
      - Make sure to use the concept of 'foreign keys'.
