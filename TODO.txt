   * Need to find a way to share the "BLOC LOC TABLE" with all the users.
   * Each peer with a copy of the table is very "blockchain" in nature.
     Maybe want to avoid it.
   * Thinking of making a single copy of the table with the server.
   * The peer can request to view the table at any time.
   * The server will respond with the filenames, from which, the peer can
     select the file to download.

  * The filenames transfer from server to client is complete.
  * Theres a bug in the DHT table after introducing the 'num_blocks' attribute to 
    the file structure fix it.

** Now that some mysql using C api testing is done, start implementing it.
  * Implement the login databse.
      - First create the required tables manually in mysql.
      - Make sure to use the concept of 'foreign keys'.

** Trying my hand on compression:
  * Where should the compression happen?
    - Ideally on the client side, to save network bandwidth, trading off with the
      simplicity of client side architecture.
    - Maybe encrypting in future, so first compress, then encrypt.
    - Starting with client side encryption.

  * Arithmetic Encoding :
    - Frequently used characters stored with fever bits, than non frewuent characters.
    - Encodes entire message into a single floating point number. Represents the current information as a range, defined by two numbers.
      - Model : Predicts the probability of occurance of a character.
      - Encoder/Decodr : Encodes/decodes based on the model.
    - The conceptual idea of an arithmetic coding model is that each symbol will own its own unique segment of the number line of real numbers between 0 and 1.

  * Asymmetric Numeral System :
    - The basic idea is to encode information into a single natural number x.
