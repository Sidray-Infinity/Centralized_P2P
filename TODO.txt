   * So the block splitting and transfer to peers is working well,
     atleast for the first file.
   * The final file name for the second file to be uploaded is somehow changed.
   * Debugg the uability to upload second file.

   * Need to find a way to share the "BLOC LOC TABLE" with all the users.
   * Each peer with a copy of the table is very "blockchain" in nature.
     Maybe want to avoid it.
   * Thinking of making a single copy of the table with the server.
   * The peer can request to view the table at any time.
   * The server will respond with the filenames, from which, the peer can
     select the file to download.
